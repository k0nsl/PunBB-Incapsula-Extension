*** PunBB Incapsula Extension ***

I decided to write an extension for PunBB for those having a site (or domain, rather) on the Incapsula service. The extension will simply output the correct IP address, because in all other cases the IP of the Incapsula service will be shown as the originating IP all across your PunBB forum; which can be a pain if you’re planning to be able to ban a person/spambot.

This extension could of course be beneficial in other instances than what I mentioned, but generally speaking this would be the most useful scenario.

Now, granted I have not tried the extension myself I’m fairly sure that it’ll work “out of the box” just fine. If it doesn’t work just tell me exactly what’s wrong and include logs and specifics about your PHP version or other relevant details.

Admittedly I have never done a PunBB extension before but this syntax can’t be wrong. I went through the manifest twice for any obvious wrongs but couldn’t find jack shit, and the main Incapsula code in incapsula.php comes straight from the horses mouth, Incapsula. I merely wrote the syntax in the manifest and included the incapsula main code. Simple, as I say 

If you do, however, encounter something wrong with my extension you can contact me via this page.

[UPDATE: I've now tried the extension and it works.]
